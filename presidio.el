;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides two interactive commands to anonymize and deanonymize
;; text using a Python placeholder anonymizer script distributed alongside it.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; 1. Run `M-x presidio-anonymize-region' on a selected region containing text
;;    with sensitive PII. This will replace the region with anonymized placeholders,
;;    using a JSON mapping file to store original values.
;;
;; 2. After externally revising the anonymized text, select the revised text and run
;;    `M-x presidio-deanonymize-region' to restore the original PII from the JSON
;;    mapping file.
;;
;; By default, the JSON mapping file is stored under
;; `presidio-placeholder-mapping-file' (~/.cache/presidio_mapping.json).
;;
;; Python dependencies (must be installed):
;;   pip install presidio_analyzer presidio_anonymizer
;;   python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
;;
